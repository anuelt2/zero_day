# My First Git Repository

Welcome to my first Git repository(not exactly) as an ALX software engineering student. This project is part of familiarizing myself with Git and GitHub as a part of my learning journey.

## Introduction

I do not fully know what this repository will contain yet at this point, but this document will be updated as and when it is necessary.

## Text Editor

I am using Emacs to type this, and trying out Markdown for the first time. I am excited to be on this journey!

My first ever introduction to Emacs was in this program barely two weeks ago.
